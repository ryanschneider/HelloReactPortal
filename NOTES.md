Presentation notes
==================


Slide 1: What is React Native

* we'll get into JSX a little later

Slide 2: What Isn't

* 

Demo:

* Add hello-react-mock data
* replace render function with hello-react-render-mock
* replace style sheet with hello-react-mock-style
* replace <Image/> with hello-react-image
* now that we've rendered one movie, skip to the end
  `git checkout steps/3-skip-to-the-end`
* explain REQUEST_URL
* getInitialState - this.state contains runtime state
* componentDidMount - called when component added to view
* render - called whenever state changes
* fetchData - notice call to this.setState(...)
* styles - flexbox
